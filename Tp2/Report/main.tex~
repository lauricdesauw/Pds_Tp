\section{De Bruijn Graph}
We have used a De Bruijn Graph to represent the set of $k$\_mer contain in the reads. The DBG is then use in a deep parcour to fill
the gap. 

\subsection{Generating the DBG}
First, because a $k$\_mer can exist in two forms, the canonical one and it reverse complement.
We define the canonical representation as the smallest in lexical order. 

The method to generate the DBG from the reads is quite simple. For each of the reads we consider all the subsequence of size $k$,
we then took it canonical representation. If the canonical representation is already stored in the dbg then we continue.
Else we add the canonical representation to the dbg.

On génère les unitigs avec la méthode suivante:
